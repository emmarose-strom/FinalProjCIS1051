# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Coping Skills Webpage?

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that shares different coping skills for stressful times, how to support friends, and how to learn more about stress/coping with stress.
Additionally, perhaps a section where visitors can comment things that helped them in the past?  

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Given how stressed I've been this semester, I want to make a common page for people to be able to find a bunch of new coping skills all in one place.
Therapy is expensive and not always accessible to everyone, and sometimes appointments can't be made for a long time.
Additionally, not all friends are equipped to assist with certain problems, and sometimes we want an immediate solution to calming down or getting out of an extreme situation.
I want to share some coping skills commonly taught in therapy (specifically relating to stress) and perhaps include sections pertaining to common issues (like if the user selects relationship, school, etc).
I plan on using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as taught in Homepage.  Additionally, a comments page would be nice, but I am not entirely sure on how to execute it yet, so we'll see.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NA

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

NA

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A solid outcome for me would be listing out coping skills for yourself, safe/healthy ways to support a friend in need, and a simplified path to getting professional mental health help in an aesthetically pleasing format and with working buttons/selections for font adjustments for some user interaction.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be to add more interactive parts to the website, like if you select or type in a key word, it will take you to a specific section of the page on, say, communicating better under stress or getting work done when overwhelmed.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be to include all of the above plus a comments page for users to submit tips that worked for them.

Also, the data nerd in me is inclined to look up more data on mental health across the US (like which states are the most stressed) to potentially add to a "learn more" section, but that's a more personal project that I might want to add on after the course is over.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Ultimately I have to get on top of my shit and figure out CSS first to decide on a common style for my pages.  I also want to get more into JavaScript to make the page interactive, but I am kind of overwhelmed by all the different things you can do with it at the moment so I'm
saving that for #FutureMe.  For the content of the page I need to research more coping skills besides the ones I already use as well as more educational resources.  In terms of coding...it's pretty much JavaScript that I will be tackling this week.
