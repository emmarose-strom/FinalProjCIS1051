# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I'm a stat major and think simulating something could be fun, but I'm not really sure where to go with it?
Alternatively I think doing a game could be fun.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

All by myselffffff 

## Do you have any questions of your own?


Not gonna lie, the past few weeks have put me through the ringer.  I mean it's been soul crushing. I was doing pretty well for most of quarantine and then
October 21st hit me like a dump truck on fire on a sped up conveyor belt fueled by a rocket.  I am not entirely sure how much I'll
do and at the moment I'm on "no thoughts, head empty" mode.  I still have to finish the other labs, my other classes are whack, and my personal
life is in shambles, so I'll try my best to catch up, but yeah, we're straight up not having a good time now.  Sorry for all the late stuff.
I really do like your class and coding is fun when I'm not hunting for the lost parentheses or quote or whatever error I made in my
sleep-deprived state.
