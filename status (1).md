Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've finished the basic home page and am now working on scrolling animations/dropdown menus, more buttons with more details on the different pages on the first page, and changing some of my headers into alerts.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Finishing the javascript, if I want to use a bootstrap component or not, comments

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I was thinking about adding a comments section originally, but I'm not sure if I'll get to that since I don't know how to keep input from previous users on the page (I know how to use inputs for simple google searches and stuff, but otherwise I've been stuck). Instead I might try to incorporate a google search somehow, whether it be to look at cute animal images or search for other resources.
Edit: may have just found something on StackOverflow, but if it doesn't work I'll add the search thing instead.
